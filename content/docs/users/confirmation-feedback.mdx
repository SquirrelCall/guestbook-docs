This page walks you through the basics and what to do if something feels off.

## Confirmation & Feedback

After you submit, the kiosk should show a clear success or error state.

## What success usually looks like

Common success indicators:

- A **confirmation message** like “You’re checked in”
- Your name or a timestamp displayed briefly
- The kiosk returns to the welcome screen

Some organizations also:

- Send an email confirmation
- Print a receipt

If you expected one of those and didn’t receive it, ask staff what the local process is.

## Common error messages

- **“Try again”**: the kiosk didn’t receive a valid value (often scan-related).
- **“Not recognized”**: the scanned value wasn’t found or isn’t accepted here.
- **“Required field missing”**: a form field still needs input.

## What to do next

- For scan-related errors: see [Barcode & ID Scanning](/docs/users/barcode-id-scanning)
- For repeated failures: see [Troubleshooting](/docs/users/troubleshooting)
