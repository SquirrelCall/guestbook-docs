This page walks you through the basics and what to do if something feels off.

## Barcode & ID Scanning

If the kiosk has a scanner, scanning is usually the quickest path through.

## How to scan successfully

- Hold the barcode **steady** for a second.
- Keep it **flat** (not tilted away).
- Don’t press the card against the scanner window; a little space usually helps.
- If the scanner has trouble, try **slightly closer** or **slightly farther**.

## If you’re using a camera-based scanner

Some setups use a camera instead of a dedicated scanner.

- Make sure the barcode is **in frame**.
- Avoid glare (tilt the card a bit to reduce reflections).
- Hold steady until the kiosk reacts.

## If scanning fails

Try this quick checklist:

1. **Wipe the barcode area** (smudges are real).
2. Try a **different angle**.
3. Increase or reduce distance slightly.
4. Switch to **manual entry** if the kiosk allows it.

If scanning fails repeatedly, move to [Troubleshooting](/docs/users/troubleshooting) and/or ask staff for help.
