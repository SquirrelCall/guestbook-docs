## Getting Started

Guestbook is typically used on a kiosk or tablet in a lobby, classroom, or office.

## What the flow usually looks like

1. You’ll see a **welcome screen** like this inviting you to check in.

2. Once you've swiped or scanned your ID, it will very briefly show your ID/Name like this:

3. Once the entry has been recorded on the backend, you'll see a success screen like this:

## What you might need

This varies by location, but commonly includes:
- An **ID card** or **barcode** (if you're using a scanner)
- A **reason for visit** or **department/location** (sometimes, depends on the organization)

## Accessibility notes

Guestbook is meant to be usable by anyone, are typically shouldn't require any interaction beyond a swipe or scan.
If an ID card isn't available, check with staff regarding having a barcode printed for your convenience.

If a kiosk is physically hard to use (placement, glare, reach), don’t fight it — ask staff to assist or point you to an alternate station.
