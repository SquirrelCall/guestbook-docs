This page walks you through the basics and what to do if something feels off.

## Getting Started

Guestbook is typically used on a kiosk or tablet in a lobby, classroom, or office.

## What the flow usually looks like

1. You’ll see a **welcome screen**.
2. You’ll be prompted to **scan an ID** or **enter your information**.
3. You may be asked for a couple extra details (depends on the organization).
4. You’ll get a **confirmation** that you’re checked in.

## What you might need

This varies by location, but commonly includes:

- An **ID card** or **barcode** (if scanning is enabled)
- Your **name** (manual entry)
- A **reason for visit** or **department/location** (sometimes)

## Accessibility notes

Guestbook is meant to be usable on:

- Touchscreens
- A keyboard
- A hardware barcode scanner (when present)

If a kiosk is physically hard to use (placement, glare, reach), don’t fight it — ask staff to assist or point you to an alternate station.
