Guestbook is designed to be simple at the point of use: walk up, enter or scan, confirm, done.

This section covers:

- **Getting started:** what the flow looks like and what you might need.
- **Signing in:** manual entry vs scanning.
- **Scanning help:** tips for barcode/ID success.
- **Troubleshooting:** what to try before you hunt down a human.
- **Privacy:** what data is collected and how it’s used (at a high level).
