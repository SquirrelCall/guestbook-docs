Guestbook is designed to be simple at the point of use: Swipe or scan, no touch required. In many use-cases, training the users wouldn't be an option, or a smart use of a guests limited time.  Our kiosks are designed to be as intuitive as possible.

This section covers:
- **[Getting Started](/docs/users/getting-started):** what the flow looks like and what you might need.
- **[Barcode & ID Scanning](/docs/users/barcode-id-scanning):** tips for barcode/ID success.
- **[Confirmation & Feedback](/docs/users/confirmation-feedback)**: Because you can't fix "Error" without feedback.
- **[Troubleshooting](/docs/users/troubleshooting):** what to try before asking staff for help.
- **[Privacy & Data Use](/docs/users/privacy-data-use):** what data is collected and how it’s used/stored/removed (simplified).

## Who this is for

This section is for **people checking in**.

If you’re deploying or managing kiosks, head to **[Administrators](/docs/admin)**. If you’re integrating systems or working on the code, head to **[Developers and Integrators](/docs/developers)**.
