This page walks you through the basics and what to do if something feels off.

## Troubleshooting

This is the “before I go find someone” checklist.

## The kiosk isn’t responding

- Try a different spot on the screen (some touchscreens have dead zones).
- If there’s a keyboard, try **Tab** and **Enter** to see if focus is moving.
- If the screen looks frozen for more than a few seconds, don’t spam taps — it can make things worse.

## Scanning isn’t working

- Check [Barcode & ID Scanning](/docs/users/barcode-id-scanning) for quick fixes.
- Try manual entry if it’s available.

## The kiosk reset mid-way

- This usually means a timeout.
- Start again and move a little quicker through the form.

## I entered something wrong

Depending on configuration, you may be able to:

- Use a back button
- Edit the field and resubmit

If not, staff may need to correct it on their side.

## Who to contact

If you’re stuck, tell staff:

- Where the kiosk is located
- What you were trying to do (scan vs manual)
- What you saw on screen (error text is helpful)
- The approximate time it happened
