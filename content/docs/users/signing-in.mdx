This page walks you through the basics and what to do if something feels off.

## Signing In

Most Guestbook kiosks support **one or both** of these methods:

- **Manual entry** (type your info)
- **Scan an ID/barcode** (fastest when available)

What you see depends on how the organization configured the kiosk.

## Manual entry

You may be asked for:

- Name
- Email (optional in many setups)
- Reason for visit
- Department, location, or host

### Common messages

- **“This field is required”** means you can’t submit without it.
- **“Invalid format”** usually means something like an email address is missing `@`.

## Scanning an ID or barcode

If scanning is enabled, you’ll typically:

1. Hold your ID under the scanner (or in view of the camera, if used)
2. Wait for the kiosk to fill in or accept the value
3. Confirm any remaining fields

If scanning doesn’t work right away, jump to [Barcode & ID Scanning](/docs/users/barcode-id-scanning).

## Timeouts and restarts

Some kiosks reset after a short period of inactivity.

If the screen resets mid-way:

- Start over
- Scan again (if you were scanning)
- Ask staff for help if it repeatedly happens
