This page focuses on practical operational details and the decisions that affect day-to-day support.

## What “configuration” usually means

Most orgs care about three categories:

1. **Branding and guidance**
   - Welcome text
   - Logo/identity (if enabled)
   - Basic instructions and disclosures

2. **Form fields**
   - Required vs optional fields
   - Field labels that match local language (“Student ID” vs “Badge”)
   - Location/department selection patterns (if used)

3. **Policy-driven behavior**
   - Retention expectations (org policy)
   - Consent/disclosure messaging (where required)
   - What happens when validation fails (clear messages)

## Field configuration guidelines

- Keep the kiosk flow short
- Only ask for information you actually use
- Prefer structured choices when you plan to report on them
- Avoid “notes” fields unless staff routinely need them

## Accessibility considerations

- Large tap targets and readable contrast
- Keyboard-only support where kiosks may use a scanner as keyboard input
- Clear error messages that explain what to do next
