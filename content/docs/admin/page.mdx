This page focuses on practical operational details and the decisions that affect day-to-day support.

## Who this section is for

This section is for people who **deploy, configure, and support** Guestbook day-to-day: IT staff, site owners, and anyone responsible for keeping kiosks healthy.

## What you’ll find here

- Deployment models and environment requirements
- Device and kiosk management (setup, binding, resets)
- Configuration and policy-driven settings
- Monitoring, troubleshooting, and escalation basics

## If you’re in the wrong place

- If you’re **signing in at a kiosk**, start in **Users**.
- If you’re **building integrations or extending behavior**, jump to **Developers & Integrators**.

## How this documentation is organized

Everything here is written from an admin/operator perspective. When you need implementation detail, we’ll link you over to the developer docs explicitly.
