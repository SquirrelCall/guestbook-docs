This page focuses on practical operational details and the decisions that affect day-to-day support.

## Network exposure (high-level)

- Keep admin surfaces behind authenticated access
- Avoid exposing kiosk endpoints publicly unless required
- Prefer segmented networks for kiosks where possible

## Physical security

Kiosks are public-facing by design. Plan for:
- Curious hands
- Accidental unplugging
- Power cycling
- Peripheral tampering

## Data handling

- Assume exports contain PII
- Keep access limited and auditable
- Prefer policy over tribal knowledge
