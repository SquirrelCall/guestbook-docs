This page focuses on practical operational details and the decisions that affect day-to-day support.

## First triage questions

- Is this one kiosk or all kiosks?
- Did anything change recently (network, updates, policy)?
- Is the failure consistent or intermittent?
- Can you reproduce it?

## Common symptoms

### Kiosk can’t reach the backend
- Verify network path and DNS
- Check whether other services are affected
- Capture timestamps and locations

### Scanner input stopped working
- Confirm it’s still recognized by the OS
- Test input in a basic text field
- Swap hardware if you need to isolate the cause quickly

### UI freezes or won’t reset
- Restart the kiosk app
- Reboot the device if needed
- If it recurs, capture steps to reproduce and escalate

## Escalation checklist

When escalating to the dev/integrator team, include:
- Kiosk identifier and location
- Date/time (with timezone)
- What the user was doing
- What you expected vs what happened
- Any logs or screenshots available
