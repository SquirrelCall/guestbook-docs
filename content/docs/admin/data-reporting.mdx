This page focuses on practical operational details and the decisions that affect day-to-day support.

## What data is collected (admin view)

Guestbook entries typically include:
- Identity fields (configured by your org)
- Timestamp and kiosk/device context
- Optional location/department tags
- Optional freeform fields (if enabled)

Your configuration determines the exact shape.

## Common workflows

- Attendance reporting for an event/session window
- Visitor logs by location and date
- Investigating “did they check in?” questions

## Exports

Exports are powerful and risky.

- Treat exported files as sensitive
- Share them intentionally
- Store them according to your org’s policy (and delete when no longer needed)

## Retention

Retention should match policy and purpose.
If you don’t have a policy, decide one early—retention is easiest to manage before you have years of data.
