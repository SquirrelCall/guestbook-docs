This page focuses on practical operational details and the decisions that affect day-to-day support.

## What “healthy” looks like

- Kiosk can reach the backend reliably
- Kiosk UI is responsive and returns to its start state between sessions
- Peripheral input is consistent (scanner/camera/touch)
- Timestamps and reporting look sane

## What to monitor (MVP)

- Service availability (up/down)
- Kiosk check-in heartbeat (if supported)
- Error rate trends (spikes matter more than isolated errors)

## Alerting expectations

Alerts should answer:
- What broke?
- Where is it?
- Who owns the fix?
- What’s the immediate workaround?

Avoid noisy alerts. If everything is urgent, nothing is.
