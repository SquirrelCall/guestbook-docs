This page focuses on practical operational details and the decisions that affect day-to-day support.

## What admins “own” for devices

- Initial provisioning (hardware + software)
- Binding the kiosk to the correct organization/location
- Ensuring peripherals work (scanner/camera/touchscreen)
- Reset/reprovision workflows

## Provisioning checklist (practical)

- Verify the device boots cleanly and is managed (policies applied)
- Confirm Guestbook launches reliably (auto-start if required)
- Confirm the kiosk can reach the backend
- Confirm time is correct (NTP or managed time source)
- Validate peripherals:
  - Barcode scanner input
  - Camera stream (if used)
  - Touch input / keyboard input

## Binding a device

Binding should answer two questions:
1. **Which organization** does this kiosk belong to?
2. **Which location/context** should entries be tagged with?

After binding:
- Validate the UI reflects the correct org/location
- Submit a test entry and confirm it lands where expected

## Reset vs reprovision

### Reset
Use when:
- The kiosk UI is stuck
- A session needs clearing
- A peripheral state is bad and a restart fixes it

Expect:
- The kiosk returns to a known start screen
- No policy/config should be lost

### Reprovision
Use when:
- The device identity/binding is wrong
- The install is corrupted or out of date
- The OS environment drifted too far

Expect:
- Rebinding and validation steps are required afterward
- You should treat it like a “new kiosk” again
