This page focuses on practical operational details and the decisions that affect day-to-day support.

## Kiosk mode vs shared workstation

### Kiosk mode
Best when Guestbook is a dedicated station (lobby, front desk, lab entrance).

- Predictable hardware and flow
- Easier to support because the environment is controlled
- Physical placement matters (traffic flow, privacy, power)

### Shared workstation
Best when Guestbook shares a machine with other tasks.

- More variability (updates, user profiles, competing software)
- Requires tighter OS policy and clear ownership
- Higher risk of “it worked yesterday” surprises

## Connected vs limited connectivity

Guestbook works best when it can consistently reach its backend services. If you’re in an environment with intermittent connectivity:

- Decide what “offline” should mean operationally (block sign-in vs allow and sync later)
- Make sure staff expectations match behavior (especially for attendance reporting)

## Environment requirements (high-level)

- Stable network path to the backend
- Reliable time on the device (timestamps matter)
- A support path for kiosk reboots, updates, and peripheral failures

## Recommended default

If you’re unsure, start with **dedicated kiosk mode** on managed hardware with a stable network path. It’s the most predictable operating point.
