This page focuses on practical operational details and the decisions that affect day-to-day support.

## Roles (conceptual)

Guestbook typically needs a small set of roles. Keep it boring.

- **Admin / Owner**: can manage devices, configuration, and data access
- **Manager**: can view and export data, may manage limited configuration
- **Viewer**: read-only access for reporting/oversight

## Least privilege, in plain language

Give people the minimum access needed to do their job.
- Don’t hand out admin just because it’s easier
- Treat exports as sensitive by default (they can contain PII)

## Account lifecycle basics

- Use named accounts (avoid shared credentials)
- Remove access when staff change roles
- Document who owns break-glass access for emergencies
