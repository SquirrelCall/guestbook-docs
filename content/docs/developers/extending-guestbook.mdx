This page lays out the technical contract, assumptions, and the failure modes you should plan for.

## Extension philosophy

- Prefer configuration over forks
- Prefer additive hooks/plugins over patching core flows
- Keep upgrade paths predictable

## Safe extension areas (conceptual)

- Custom fields and validation rules (when supported)
- Branding and messaging
- Export formats and downstream pipelines
- Webhook/event integrations (when supported)

## High-risk areas

- Rewriting the kiosk session flow without clear requirements
- Changing identity/provisioning behavior ad-hoc
- Embedding org-specific logic directly into the kiosk UI
