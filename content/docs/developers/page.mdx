This page lays out the technical contract, assumptions, and the failure modes you should plan for.

## Who this section is for

This section is for people building or integrating systems around Guestbook: API consumers, platform engineers, and developers extending deployments.

## What you’ll find here

- Architecture and trust boundaries
- Backend interaction patterns
- Device identity and provisioning concepts
- Scanner/camera integration models
- Configuration, logging, and observability basics

## If you’re in the wrong place

- If you’re operating kiosks day-to-day, head to **Administrators**.
- If you’re using a kiosk to check in, start in **Users**.

## This section’s contract

We’ll be precise and avoid guessing. When details are implementation-specific, the docs should either:
- link to the canonical source, or
- clearly label placeholders until the implementation is finalized.
