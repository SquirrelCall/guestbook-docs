This page lays out the technical contract, assumptions, and the failure modes you should plan for.

## Hardware scanner input (keyboard wedge)

Most barcode scanners act like a keyboard:
- Input arrives as a burst of characters
- Often includes a terminator (e.g., Enter)

Implementation notes:
- Debounce repeated scans
- Handle partial input and timeouts
- Avoid double-submission when Enter is present

## Camera-based scanning (sidecar model)

Browsers can be constrained by camera permissions, autofocus behavior, and barcode decoding performance.

A sidecar can:
- own camera access
- stream a preview (optional)
- expose a next-scan endpoint or event channel

## Failure modes to handle

- No camera available / permission denied
- Scanner disconnected
- Unrecognized barcode formats
- Poor lighting or motion blur
