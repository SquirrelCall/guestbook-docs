This page lays out the technical contract, assumptions, and the failure modes you should plan for.

## Goals

- A kiosk can prove it is an approved device
- A kiosk can be bound to an org/location context
- Access can be revoked if a device is compromised or retired
- Rotation is possible without reimaging everything

## Provisioning flow (conceptual)

1. Create device identity (unique identifier + secret/token)
2. Bind identity to org/location context
3. Kiosk fetches config using its identity
4. Kiosk submits entries as that identity

## Rotation and revocation

- Rotation: replace credentials without replacing the device
- Revocation: invalidate a device identity and force re-provisioning

## Threat model assumptions

- Physical access is plausible
- Network is not always reliable
- Kiosk UX must remain simple even when identity fails
