This page lays out the technical contract, assumptions, and the failure modes you should plan for.

## Status

This page intentionally remains a placeholder until the API surface is stable enough to document as a reference.

When implemented, this section should include:
- Endpoint catalog
- Payload schemas
- Error envelopes and retry semantics
- Versioning and compatibility policy

Until then, keep API details close to the canonical source (OpenAPI, typed client, or backend docs) to avoid drift.
