This page lays out the technical contract, assumptions, and the failure modes you should plan for.

## Components (conceptual)

Guestbook typically includes:

- **Frontend kiosk UI**: the user-facing sign-in experience
- **Backend services**: identity, configuration, entry storage, and reporting surfaces
- **Device runtime**: kiosk OS + packaging/runtime behavior
- **Optional sidecar services**: local scanning/camera helpers when browser constraints exist

## Data flow (high-level)

1. Kiosk loads configuration for its org/location context
2. User provides input (manual entry, scan, or camera capture)
3. Kiosk submits an entry payload to the backend
4. Backend validates, stores, and exposes the entry for reporting/admin use

## Trust boundaries

- Kiosks are physically exposed. Assume they can be touched.
- Admin surfaces require strong authentication and least privilege.
- Entry data often includes PII—treat it as sensitive by default.
