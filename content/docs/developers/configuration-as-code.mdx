This page lays out the technical contract, assumptions, and the failure modes you should plan for.

## Configuration goals

- Safe defaults
- Explicit overrides
- Environment separation (dev/stage/prod)
- Minimal per-device drift

## Typical configuration sources

- Environment variables (build/runtime)
- Remote configuration fetched at startup
- Local device configuration for binding and identity (where appropriate)

## Precedence (recommended)

1. Device-local identity/binding context
2. Remote org configuration
3. Environment defaults

Keep it boring. Boring is maintainable.
