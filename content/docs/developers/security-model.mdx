This page lays out the technical contract, assumptions, and the failure modes you should plan for.

## Baseline assumptions

- Kiosks are exposed to the public
- Users may attempt accidental or intentional misuse
- PII may be present in entries and exports

## High-level controls

- Strong authentication for admin surfaces
- Least privilege for data access
- Rate limiting / abuse controls where appropriate
- Secure transport (TLS) for network calls

## Input security

- Validate server-side (always)
- Sanitize where it helps, but don’t rely on client-side enforcement
- Keep error messages helpful but not leaky
