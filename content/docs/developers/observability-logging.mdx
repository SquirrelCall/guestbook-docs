This page lays out the technical contract, assumptions, and the failure modes you should plan for.

## What to log

- App startup and configuration load
- Entry submission attempts and outcomes (redact PII)
- Device identity failures (without leaking secrets)
- Scanner/camera initialization outcomes

## Redaction rules

- Never log raw secrets/tokens
- Treat user-entered fields as sensitive by default
- Prefer structured logs with explicit fields over dumping objects

## Health checks

Provide a simple health endpoint or signal that answers:
- Is the service alive?
- Can it reach dependencies?
- Is it degraded?
