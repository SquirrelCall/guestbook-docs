This page lays out the technical contract, assumptions, and the failure modes you should plan for.

## Debugging checklist

- Reproduce reliably (or define trigger conditions)
- Separate concerns:
  - client UI
  - device runtime/peripherals
  - backend services
  - network path

## Common issues

### Device identity failures
- Confirm provisioning and binding
- Confirm revocation/rotation behavior
- Avoid leaking secrets in logs while debugging

### Scanner/camera failures
- Validate OS-level device availability
- Validate permissions and runtime constraints
- Check for initialization race conditions

### API contract mismatch
- Confirm client/server versions
- Confirm payload shapes and error envelopes
- Prefer backward-compatible fixes where possible
