This page lays out the technical contract, assumptions, and the failure modes you should plan for.

## Communication patterns

Keep the kiosk frontend predictable:
- Prefer simple request/response calls for core actions (config fetch, entry submit)
- Treat network failures as normal, not exceptional
- Provide user-visible feedback that doesn’t leak internal details

## Error taxonomy (conceptual)

- **Validation errors**: user can fix input (highlight fields, explain next steps)
- **Auth/identity errors**: device mis-provisioned or revoked (admin action required)
- **Network errors**: retryable with backoff (give users a clear try-again path)
- **Server errors**: log and surface a generic failure message

## Contract stability

If you version APIs:
- Keep backward compatibility for kiosk devices where possible
- Prefer additive changes over breaking payload reshapes
